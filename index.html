                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello! I'm Kyle Sullivan, a developer based in Northwest Arkansas. My work centers around creating clean and efficient websites with a focus on user experience.
                When I'm afk, you'll likely find me enjoying the outdoors, whether it's on the rink at the Jones Center, playing a round of disc golf, hitting one of the local trails, or floating one of the many rivers. Living in Northwest Arkansas provides the perfect backdrop for exploring nature and it's easy to find an excuse to go outside.</p>
